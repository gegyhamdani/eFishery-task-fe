When opening app, Directly display a table containing commodity data.
The use of a white base color with a little outline gives a simple impression.
The data displayed by default is 10 data per table, where there is a scroll that can be used to view the data below. The data displayed is not too much so that the user is not too difficult to see the data one by one, however, the data that can be displayed can be changed via the button below.

There are 2 buttons, namely the Add button and the Search button.
No text is added to the button because the icon is sufficient to present what is meant by the button, besides that, if the button is hovered, information appears regarding what button is meant.

### Add Data

In the top of form, there is a title to tell the form what this is, besides that there is a cross button in the upper right corner to close the modal form.
Save button filled with green background, so the button can provide a distinctive color and the user can see the button.
